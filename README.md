This repository contains all the homework assignments from my Data Structures course, showcasing practical implementations of various data structures and algorithms. The projects are developed using C++, with each assignment focusing on a specific topic and data structure. Here’s an overview of each homework:

Homework 1: Maze Generation and Pathfinding
In this assignment, I developed a program to generate random MxN mazes and find paths between designated entry and exit points. The maze generation is achieved by knocking down walls between cells, using a custom stack implemented with a linked list. The solution emphasizes stack operations for both maze creation and pathfinding, adhering to strict rules of connectivity and uniqueness for the generated paths​(Homework1).

Homework 2: Phonebook Management with Trees
This project involves creating a phonebook application that manages contact information using Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL Tree implementations. It supports operations like searching, adding, and deleting contacts while comparing performance differences between the two data structures. The solution includes methods for in-order and pre-order printing, and tree visualization, providing an insightful comparison of the efficiency of balanced and unbalanced trees​(Homework2).

Homework 3: Marketing Strategy Analysis Using Hash Tables
In this homework, I developed a tool for analyzing sales relations between products based on customer transactions. It uses a templated hash table with separate chaining to efficiently store and retrieve support values of item sets, followed by extracting association rules based on given support and confidence thresholds. The program outputs rules that help identify product pairs or sets that are frequently bought together, aiding in marketing strategies like co-promotion and targeted advertisements​(Homework 3).

Homework 5: Sorting and Search Comparison
This assignment extends the phonebook project by implementing sorting algorithms to organize the phonebook data and then conducting search operations. It includes four sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort, with performance comparisons for each. Additionally, search operations using Binary Search, BST, and AVL Tree are implemented, offering a comprehensive analysis of sorting and searching techniques on phonebook data​(Homework 5).
